## General Info
This notebook is based off of some old coursework.  It is currently changed to use OpenCV to take in interactively provided points on an input image and compute the shortest path between them, in order of input.

## To Do
- Make it so colors of lines match color of points? - Depends on line width, original points currently covered up usually.  
- Decide on line width, colors, etc
- Error handling for when a path is not possible to complete
